Note that pubic symphysis appears to be present according to the structure of the illium. I.e: the hip bones have expanded to accommodate for growth in the womb.

Miss J, approaching the Confessional. I tucked myself beneath a pew. And I knew in my heart that I shouldn't, but I did. I listened. I listened to my own Father lecturing her on the unborn baby in her womb and what would happen if this got out. Saying it was all her fault. They never should have done what they did. And I heard her begin to cry and scream. I ran. I fell, gashing my leg on the dusty earth and I didn't stop until I reached the dam and I dove into the murky tortoiseshell water and let it swallow me whole.

Robert.

It shames me greatly coming to you like this, but I have been left with no choice. You are a family man yourself, you know the importance of doing anything you can to protect those who depend on you. 

Priscilla is a smart girl, despite what her reputation and actions would suggest. She may yet have a future. Please, I beg of you, spare our family the sullying of our name. My wife is already battling a fever in her pregnancy, it breaks my soul to imagine what may happen if she is made aware of Priscilla's indescretion. I do not want her isolated from the other women in this community, she needs them. What would you do in my situation? You would not want to ruin your daughter's livelihood, you would do anything you can to save her from alienation. 

Please, take what little I have and promise me that this will //never// see the light of day. I will be forever indebted to you.

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="Fall From Grace" tags="Evidence" position="1500,2300" size="100,100">//Local police have today announced the official removal of Detective Inspector Robert Deacon from his role heading the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of high school English teacher and resident Daphne Marie Jones. Miss Jones was last seen on the 31st of October, at around 5:30, walking back from Sentry Creek Secondary School, towards her home on Silent Hill. Her neighbour, Mrs Deborah Forsythe, said the following of the brief exchange they shared in the street: "She seemed completely normal. I didn't ask her what she was doing later...It didn't occur to me that I wouldn't see her ever again." The removal of Deacon arrives on the coattails of shocking allegations about police involvement in a financial corruption coup. Sentry Creek Mayor Paul Reid has been accused of sinking public funds into his own accounts; a revelation made at the hands of both his book-keeper James Hurst and his secretary Suzette MacNab. An investigation into the depth of corruption in local government - and conspiracy to cover it up by the police - has been promised by Chief Commissioner Gregory Salt. In a press conference on Monday, Salt said the following "I am unable to comment on what is currently part of an ongoing investigation, but I will say that Metropolitan Melbourne Police have been asked to take charge of the investigation...We are not of the belief that Detective Inspector Deacon was involved in the disappearance of Miss Jones, but we are aware of certain factors tying him to the possibility of financial corruption in Sentry Creek." More to come.//
